    "abstract": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

    "abstract": "Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.",

The Sep-Former learns short and long-term dependencies with a multi-scale approach that employs transformers. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the standard WSJ0-2/3mix datasets. It reaches an SI-SNRi of 22.3 dB on WSJ0-2mix and an SI-SNRi of 19.5 dB on WSJ0-3mix.

It is thus significantly faster and it is less memory-demanding than the latest speech separation systems with comparable performance.",

To alleviate the limitation, we propose a simple but effective deep neural network for video frame interpolation, which is end-to-end trainable and is free from a motion estimation network component. Our algorithm employs a special feature reshaping operation, referred to as PixelShuffle, with a channel attention, which replaces the optical flow computation module. The main idea behind the design is to distribute the information in a feature map into multiple channels and extract motion information by attending the channels for pixel-level frame synthesis. The model given by this principle turns out to be effective in the presence of challenging motion and occlusion. We construct a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves outstanding performance compared to the existing models with a component for optical flow computation.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyperparameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.",

Specifically, the efficient combination of CNNs and Transformers is investigated, and a hybrid architecture called Lite-Mono is presented. A Consecutive Dilated Convolutions (CDC) module and a Local-Global Features Interaction (LGFI) module are proposed.

Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like\"Let's think step by step\"to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the\"Let's think step by step\"prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

    "abstract": "As industries increasingly adopt large robotic fleets, there is a pressing need for computationally efficient, practical, and optimal conflict-free path planning for multiple robots. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular method for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) due to its completeness and optimality; however, it is often impractical for real-world applications, as it is computationally intensive to solve and relies on assumptions about agents and operating environments that are difficult to realize. This article proposes a solution to overcome computational challenges and practicality issues of CBS by utilizing structural-semantic topometric maps. Instead of running CBS over large grid-based maps, the proposed solution runs CBS over a sparse topometric map containing structural-semantic cells representing intersections, pathways, and dead ends. This approach significantly accelerates the MAPF process and reduces the number of conflict resolutions handled by CBS while operating in continuous time. In the proposed method, robots are assigned time ranges to move between topometric regions, departing from the traditional CBS assumption that a robot can move to any connected cell in a single time step. The approach is validated through real-world multi-robot path-finding experiments and benchmarking simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed MAPF method can be applied to real-world non-holonomic robots and yields significant improvement in computational efficiency compared to traditional CBS methods while improving conflict detection and resolution in cases of corridor symmetries.",

Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles.

In practice, however, MPPI encounters problems limiting its application. For instance, it has been observed that MPPI tends to make poor decisions if unmodeled dynamics or environmental disturbances exist, preventing its use in safety-critical applications. Moreover, the multi-threaded simulations used by MPPI require significant onboard computational resources, making the algorithm inaccessible to robots without modern GPUs. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel (Shield-MPPI) algorithm that provides robustness against unpredicted disturbances and achieves real-time planning using a much smaller number of parallel simulations on regular CPUs. The novel Shield-MPPI algorithm is tested on an aggressive autonomous racing platform both in simulation and in hardware.

Primarily, a dynamic weighting factor is incorporated into the conventional A* algorithm to enable adaptive modulation of the cost function. Concurrently, a mechanism for repeated node detection and updating within the Open list is devised to ensure path consistency and effectively reduce redundant node expansions. Subsequently, the initial path is refined using B-spline curve smoothing, thereby enhancing its continuity and feasibility. In the final stage, during path tracking, the MPC algorithm is employed for trajectory control, with Control Barrier Function (CBF) embedded into the control model to facilitate effective obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that, in terms of path planning, the proposed improved A* algorithm significantly enhances path generation efficiency and quality, producing shorter, smoother paths with fewer redundant nodes. In terms of path tracking, the incorporation of CBF into the MPC controller improves obstacle avoidance capability against dynamic obstacles while maintaining tracking accuracy. Overall, the proposed method outperforms the traditional A* algorithm and MPC combination in both the path planning and tracking control stages.",

Then, HyRRT-Connect constructs a motion plan through the reversal and concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, ensuring the motion plan thoroughly satisfies the given hybrid dynamics. To address the potential discontinuity along the flow caused by tolerating some distance between the forward and backward partial motion plans, we reconstruct the backward partial motion plan by a forward-in-hybrid-time simulation from the final state of the forward partial motion plan.

Control of the satellite-manipulator system is challenging because motion of the manipulator influences position and orientation of the chaser satellite. Moreover, the trajectory selected for the capture manoeuvre must be collision-free. In this article, we consider the case of a nonredundant manipulator mounted on a free-floating satellite.We propose to use the bi-directional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm to achieve two purposes: to plan a collision-free manipulator trajectory that, at the same time, will result in a desired change of the chaser satellite orientation. Several improvements are introduced in comparison to the previous applications of the RRT method for manipulator mounted on a free-floating satellite. Feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated in numerical simulations performed for the planar case in which the chaser satellite is equipped with a 2-DoF (Degree of Freedom) manipulator. The obtained results are analysed and compared with the results obtained from collision-free trajectory planning methods that do not allow to set the desired final orientation of the chaser satellite.",

Trajectory planning plays a crucial role in optimizing robot performance by enhancing work efficiency and reducing operational costs. While the widely used Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm is effective in path planning, it often generates non-optimal paths with poor smoothness. By incorporating elements from RRT-Connect and reverse optimization, the algorithm can efficiently navigate through intricate and dynamic surroundings. Furthermore, the utilization of cubic polynomial interpolation in optimizing path curves adds a layer of sophistication to the trajectory planning process. This interpolation technique allows for the creation of smoother and more natural path trajectories, reducing jerky movements and enhancing overall motion control precision. The paths produced by the enhanced RRT algorithm demonstrate increased continuity and visual attractiveness, crucial for tasks necessitating accurate and elegant robotic motions. The improved algorithm showcases reduced path length and time consumption, as well as enhanced path smoothness. Particularly, relative to the traditional RRT approach, the time consumption has dropped by 69.15% and the median duration of the paths has fallen by 21.11%. These improvements signify a substantial advancement in trajectory planning for robots, offering more efficient and smoother paths for robotic operations across various applications.",

Existing methods often rely on state-feedback-based CLFs and high-order CBFs (HOCBFs), which are computationally expensive to construct and fail to maintain effectiveness in dynamic environments with fast-moving, nearby obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose constructing velocity obstacle (VO)-based CBFs (VOCBFs) in the velocity space to enhance dynamic collision avoidance capabilities, instead of relying on distance-based CBFs that require the introduction of HOCBFs. Additionally, by extending VOCBFs using variants of VO, we enable reactive collision avoidance between robots. We formulate a safety-critical controller for acceleration-controlled unicycle robots as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), integrating state-feedback-based CLFs for navigation and VOCBFs for collision avoidance. To enhance the efficiency of solving the MIQP, we split the MIQP into multiple suboptimization problems and employ a decision network to reduce computational costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach effectively guides the robot to its target while avoiding collisions.

Existing learning-based MAPF methods often struggle with scalability, particularly when addressing complex scenarios that are prone to deadlocks. To address these challenges, we introduce LLMDR (LLM-Driven Deadlock Detection and Resolution), an approach designed to resolve deadlocks and improve the performance of learnt MAPF models. LLMDR integrates the inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with learnt MAPF models and prioritized planning, enabling it to detect deadlocks and provide customized resolution strategies. We evaluate LLMDR on standard MAPF benchmark maps with varying agent numbers, measuring its performance when combined with several base models. The results demonstrate that LLMDR improves the performance of learnt MAPF models, particularly in deadlock-prone scenarios, with notable improvements in success rates. These findings show the potential of integrating LLMs to improve the scalability of learning-based MAPF methods. The source code for LLMDR is available at: https://github.com/ssbacc/llmdr-dhc",

    "abstract": "Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are widely used for material handling in warehouses and automated production lines due to their high efficiency and low failure rate with respect to human operated load carriers. However, AGVs usually interact with each other because of the restricted capacity of the layout, and conflicts arise. Although many traffic scheduling algorithms have been proposed to address the AGV fleet control problem, most of them are inefficient for collision and deadlock avoidance in dynamic environments. This paper proposes an improved dynamic resource reservation (IDRR) based method which renders time-efficient task completion and deadlock-free movements of multiple AGVs in a manufacturing system. Unlike traditional approaches, most of which adopt a dynamic single agent reservation of the shared resource points and/or force path deviations, IDRR exploits dynamic multiple reservations of shared resource points. This is combined with a conflict detection and resolution method that accommodates the AGV motions when they meet at a resource point. Extensive, realistic simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed collision and deadlock prevention method in productivity, travelled distance, and time completion of the assigned tasks. The proposal can be implemented on both central and local controllers.",

Edge computing emerges as a promising solution by bringing processing closer to the data sources. However, edge computing faces challenges, particularly in terms of limited computational power, which can create constraints in the execution of machine learning (ML) tasks. This paper aims to analyze strategies for distributing ML tasks among multiple nodes based on multi-agent systems (MAS) technology to have a collaborative approach and compare these strategies to provide an overview of best practices for achieving the optimal performance in intrusion detection for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this way, the well-known CICIoT2023 data set was used, and centralized and distributed ML techniques were implemented, and evaluated. The distributed edge ML approach achieved promising results, presenting an improvement of between 7.73% and 32.18% in the correction of wrong predictions of detection of attacks on IoT devices, significantly improving the precision and recall of the applied techniques.",

PIEE enables clinicians and informatics teams to simulate adversarial prompts, including jailbreaking, social engineering, and distractor attacks, to stress-test language models in real-world clinical scenarios.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader application in this domain warrants systematic investigation.

Specifically, this survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this field.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven approaches for autonomous driving (AD) have been widely adopted in the past decade but are confronted with dataset bias and uninterpretability. Inspired by the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, recent approaches explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve understanding and decision-making in traffic scenarios. They find that the pretrain-finetune paradigm of LLMs on downstream data with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process can enhance explainability and scene understanding. However, such a popular strategy proves to suffer from the notorious problems of misalignment between the crafted CoTs against the consequent decision-making, which remains untouched by previous LLM-based AD methods. To address this problem, we motivate an end-to-end decision-making model based on multimodality-augmented LLM, which simultaneously executes CoT reasoning and carries out planning results. Furthermore, we propose a reasoning-decision alignment constraint between the paired CoTs and planning results, imposing the correspondence between reasoning and decision-making. Moreover, we redesign the CoTs to enable the model to comprehend complex scenarios and enhance decision-making performance. We dub our proposed large language planners with reasoning-decision alignment as RDA-Driver. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our RDA-Driver in enhancing the performance of end-to-end AD systems. Specifically, our RDA-Driver achieves state-of-the-art planning performance on the nuScenes dataset with 0.80 L2 error and 0.32 collision rate, and also achieves leading results on challenging DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks with 0.82 L2 error and 0.38 collision rate.",

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini has shown their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.",

However, as these systems evolve, the demand for better adaptability and coordination continues to grow to maximize their overall effectiveness and efficiency. To achieve this, we propose the Multi-Personality Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning (MPMA-MRL) framework. This approach incorporates multiple meta-trained, meta-tested explainable personality policies, which are deployed to each agent. A personality selector is trained and deployed on each agent to optimize the overall performance. MPMA-MRL is superior than traditional methods in terms of the adaptability and coordination in ITS by leveraging improved information from the environment, more practical coordination among agents, faster adaptation speed to intermediate tasks, and more appropriate allocation and planning. The proposed framework is evaluated in the applications of parking lot optimization and EV charging station allocation. Its broader impact on multi-agent smart systems is analyzed to demonstrate its generalizability. The results demonstrate that in parking lot optimization, MPMA-MRL significantly reduces the time required to direct all vehicles to available parking spots. In EV charging station allocation, MPMA-MRL effectively minimizes waiting times at charging stations. Moreover, in both applications, MPMA-MRL exhibits enhanced adaptability to previously unseen scenarios, improving its applicability.",

Three aspects are considered when evaluating the performance of the MASs: overhead due to the MASs, improvement of the resource usage of the devices as well as latency and error rate. In summary, the agents’ resource usage with respect to traffic, computing resources and time is very low.

Since this control needs to not only ensure the optimizing system performance but also synchronize the multiple system state variables, it is an interesting and challenging topic. In order to achieve this optimized control, the neural network approximation-based reinforcement learning (RL) is performed under critic-actor architecture. In most of the existing RL-based optimal controls, since both the critic and actor RL updating laws are derived from the negative gradient of square of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation’s approximation, which contains multiple nonlinear terms, their algorithm are inevitably intricate. However, the proposed optimized control derives the RL updating laws from the negative gradient of a simple positive function, which is correlated with the HJB equation; hence, it can be significantly simple in the algorithm. Meanwhile, it can also release two general conditions, known dynamic and persistence excitation, which are required in most of the RL-based optimal controls. Therefore, the proposed optimized scheme can be a natural selection for the high-order nonlinear multi-agent control. Finally, the effectiveness is demonstrated by both theory and simulation.",

For a robot to successfully navigate its environment, it must have the ability to detect and avoid obstacles. This is where FSM comes into play to model robot behavior and decision-making processes. The output actions of FSM include forward action, reverse action, right turn action, and left turn action. This action allows the hexapod robot to avoid obstacles in its path by adjusting its movements. FSM is designed to transition between states based on sensory input, such as information from the robot’s sensors, to determine the best action to be taken in response to the presence of an obstruction. The design of the FSM is described in detail, and its performance is evaluated in simulations. Results show that the effectively designed FSM allows the hexapod robot to avoid obstacles in its environment, while ensuring efficient and safe navigation.

In this paper, we propose a modelling approach for formal development of control systems based on the application of iUML-B state machine patterns to model the four synchronization patterns of the typical control system. Then, we use the instantiation of iUML-B pattern state machine to establish a typical multilevel control system's Event-B model. The simulation results show that the event trace of the model obtained using our method is the same as that of the corresponding model obtained using the traditional Event-B design pattern. Compared with the traditional Event-B design pattern method, our method can greatly reduce the manual coding burden in the modelling process.

Heuristic-based search algorithms like A* have been shown to be efficient in solving such planning problems. Recently, there has been an increased interest in specifying complex path planning problem using temporal logic. In the state-of-the-art algorithm, the temporal logic path planning problem is reduced to a graph search problem, and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is used to compute the optimal trajectory satisfying the specification.The A* algorithm, when used with an appropriate heuristic for the distance from the destination, can generate an optimal path in a graph more efficiently than Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The primary challenge for using A* algorithm in temporal logic path planning is that there is no notion of a single destination state for the robot. We present a novel path planning algorithm T* that uses the A* search procedure opportunistically to generate an optimal trajectory satisfying a temporal logic query. Our experimental results demonstrate that T* achieves an order of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art algorithm to solve many temporal logic path planning problems in 2-D as well as 3-D workspaces.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The path planned for an automated guided vehicle in, for example, a production facility is often the lowest-cost path in a (weighted) geometric graph. The weights in the graph may represent a distance or travel time. Sometimes turning costs are taken into account; turns (and decelerations before and accelerations after turning) take time, so it is desirable to minimise turns in the path. Several well-known algorithms can be used to find the lowest-cost path in a geometric graph. In this paper, we focus on the A algorithm, which uses an (internal) search heuristic to find the lowest-cost path. In the current literature, generally, either turning costs are not taken into account in the heuristic or the heuristic can only be used for specific graph structures. We propose an improved heuristic for the A algorithm that can be used to find the lowest-cost path in a geometric graph with turning costs. Our heuristic is proven to be monotone and admissible. Moreover, our heuristic provides a higher lower bound estimate for the actual costs compared to other heuristics found in the literature, causing the lowest-cost path to be found faster (i.e. with less iterations). We validate this through an extensive comparative study.",

First, establish an underwater 3D grid model, and use artificial potential field forces to generate an initial feasible path. Secondly, use the infinite folding chaotic map to expand the sparrow population and increase the diversity of the population.Then use the dynamic adjustment strategy to improve the location update formula of the sparrow search algorithm to adjust the search area range. Finally, the improved algorithm proposed is applied to solve the 3D path planning problem of underwater robots. The simulation results show that the optimization performance of the potential field sparrow search algorithm (PFSSA) proposed in this paper is better than the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and it can quickly obtain an optimal and safe feasible path, which proves the effectiveness of the method, and it has application value in the field of path planning of underwater robot.",

Two controllers, pure pursuit and fuzzy logic controller, are considered to handle robot navigation with obstacle avoidance. Ignoring the obstacles, the pure pursuit controller computes the required linear and angular velocities to direct robot from start to goal location. However, if obstacles are present in the navigation path then the robot will get collided with obstacles in the path. As a result, the robot will not reach to the provided goal location. The fuzzy logic controller is used to avoid obstacles in the navigation path. The fuzzy logic controller takes obstacle distance, obstacle angle, target direction and the x coordinate of goal location as inputs. Consequently, the fuzzy logic controller outputs the required change in angular velocity for the robot. This change in angular velocity is applied to the angular velocity provided by the pure pursuit controller. The experimental work is performed using Turtlebot Gazebo simulator. The navigation including environment, obstacles and resultant paths are also manifested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. In dynamic environments, robot path planning and obstacle avoidance are critical tasks, especially in applications such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and mobile robotics. These tasks are inherently challenging due to the unpredictability of the environment and the need for real-time decision-making. This paper seeks to address these challenges by developing and analyzing both traditional and optimized models for robot navigation. The initial model utilizes a basic Q-learning algorithm, which provides a straightforward approach to learning from the environment but often struggles with the complexity of dynamic scenarios. To this end, an optimized model is developed that combines the Double Deep Q-Learning algorithm (Double DQN) in conjunction with heuristic strategies. The research employs the MATLAB Reinforcement Learning Toolbox to implement and train these models, and utilizes a simulated environment with dynamic obstacles as a testing site. The simulation generates the necessary data to allow for comprehensive testing and evaluation of the models performance. The results show that the optimized model greatly exceeds the initial model in terms of path planning efficiency and obstacle avoidance capabilities, and that the combination of advanced reinforcement learning techniques and heuristic strategies is extremely important for enhancing the performance and reliability of robotic systems in complex, dynamic environments, offering valuable insights for future applications in various fields of robotics.",

    "abstract": "Sampling-based motion planners are widely used in robotics due to their simplicity, flexibility and computational efficiency. However, in their most basic form, these algorithms operate under the assumption of static scenes and lack the ability to avoid collisions with dynamic (i.e. moving) obstacles. This raises safety concerns, limiting the range of possible applications of mobile robots in the real world. Motivated by these challenges, in this work we present Temporal-PRM, a novel sampling-based path-planning algorithm that performs obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. The proposed approach extends the original Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) with the notion of time, generating an augmented graph-like structure that can be efficiently queried using a time-aware variant of the A* search algorithm, also introduced in this paper. Our design maintains all the properties of PRM, such as the ability to perform multiple queries and to find smooth paths, while circumventing its downside by enabling collision avoidance in highly dynamic scenes with a minor increase in the computational cost. Through a series of challenging experiments in highly cluttered and dynamic environments, we demonstrate that the proposed path planner outperforms other state-of-the-art sampling-based solvers. Moreover, we show that our algorithm can run onboard a flying robot, performing obstacle avoidance in real time.",

    "abstract": "\n Motion planning for mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments (.e.g., in multi-robot manufacturing) is challenging due to the stochastic nature of the problem. One common approach is to construct an initial plan to guide the robots. As information is collected during execution, adjustments are made in real-time to account for the impact of uncertainties. This approach, while feasible, leaves the burden of dynamic collision avoidance on controllers, which may not find collision-free and optimal control inputs fast enough. Additionally, the computational burden is exacerbated as the dimensionality of the workspace and the number and geometric complexity of obstacles increase. This paper presents a novel probabilistic roadmap (PRM)-based offline motion planner for mobile robots traveling under uncertainty. The planner considers arbitrarily-shaped holonomic robots in an environment with multiple static and dynamic obstacles. Since PRM is graph-based, we model the uncertainty by treating edge costs as general probability density functions whose exact profiles are related to the actuation characteristics of a mobile robot. The risk of success (i.e., no collision) per each action in the plan is lower-bounded by a user-defined value, allowing an informed choice between solution safety and quality. Simulations in various scenarios with both static and dynamic obstacles, and configuration spaces of different dimensions, show the effectiveness and flexibility of the planner, including scenarios contemplating prioritized multi-robot planning. Finally, we show that, under practical conditions, the proposed planner can provide time-optimal and globally risk-bounded solutions.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic roadmap (PRM) methods are widely used for robot navigation in both 2D and 3D environments; however, a major drawback is that the raw paths tend to be jagged. Executing a trajectory along such paths can lead to significant overshoots and tight turns, making it difficult to achieve a near-optimal solution under motion constraints. This paper presents an enhanced PRM-based path planning approach designed to improve path quality and computational efficiency. The method integrates advanced sampling strategies, adaptive neighbor selection with spatial data structures, and multi-stage path post-processing. In particular, shortcut smoothing and polynomial fitting are used to generate smoother trajectories suitable for motion-constrained robots. The proposed hybrid sampling scheme biases sample generation toward critical regions—near obstacles, in narrow passages, and between the start and goal—to improve graph connectivity in challenging areas. An adaptive k-d tree-based connection strategy then efficiently builds a roadmap using variable connection radii guided by PRM* theory. Once a path is found using an any-angle graph search, post-processing is applied to refine it. Unnecessary waypoints are removed via line-of-sight shortcuts, and the final trajectory is smoothed using a fitted polynomial curve. The resulting paths are shorter and exhibit gentler turns, making them more feasible for execution. In simulated complex scenarios, including narrow corridors and cluttered environments, the advanced PRM achieved a 100% success rate where standard PRM frequently failed. It also reduced calculation time to 30% and peak turning angle by up to 50% compared to conventional methods. The approach supports dynamic re-planning: when the environment changes, the roadmap is efficiently updated rather than rebuilt from scratch. Furthermore, the use of an adaptive k-d tree structure and incremental roadmap updates leads to an order-of-magnitude speedup in the connection phase. These improvements significantly increase the planner’s path quality, runtime performance, and reliability. Quantitative results are provided to substantiate the performance gains of the proposed method.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) present a potential solution, they are often hindered by issues of ‘hallucination’ and outdated knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces LAURA (A Legal Agent Using Reasoning and Acting), a novel agent-based question-answering system tailored for Vietnamese law. LAURA operates on an agentic workflow, leveraging an LLM as its core reasoning engine. The system is built on the ReAct paradigm, which synergizes reasoning with the use of retrieval tools to process legal queries effectively. To enhance accuracy and minimize errors, a custom retrieval module was developed, combining Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with the BM25 sparse retriever and the multilingual-e5 dense retriever. Furthermore, LAURA integrates Tavily Search to access the latest legal information from external sources in real-time. This integrated approach demonstrates the significant potential of combining agentic reasoning with multi-source retrieval to create an accurate and interpretable legal question-answering system for the Vietnamese language.",

    "abstract": "The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B&70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate (end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.",

This often leads to high training overhead and reduces the time financial advisors can dedicate to client relations. This paper introduces an Agentic AI Co-Pilot designed as a significant architectural advancement beyond traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The core framework leverages a specialized Enterprise AI Flow to orchestrate a modular, decoupled agent architecture. The system's central component, the Reasoning and Action Agent (RAA), which implements the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) paradigm that executes a fusion of explicit reasoning and external tool-use. This modularity allows the agent to: (1) interpret complex natural language queries, (2) articulate an internal step-by-step plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and (3) autonomously execute a sequence of decoupled, modular API tools to perform high-stakes operations. This architectural separation ensures the seamless and incremental expansion of capabilities (e.g., integrating a risk-check API or a financial market forecasting module) without the need for retraining the core reasoning model. By providing both traceability and automated execution across complex workflows, the solution aims to substantially improve operational efficiency, enhance compliance through traceable decisions, and elevate the user experience in the highly regulated financial ecosystem.",

Although large language model (LLM)-based solutions have shown potential, they often lack consistency in reasoning, effective tool orchestration, factual accuracy, and adaptability to emerging threats. In this work, we present an autonomous SOC agent that integrates the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework with detection engineering principles to overcome these challenges.

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to interact with external environments (e.g., games, APIs, world models) to solve user-provided tasks. However, current frameworks often lack the ability to collaborate effectively with users in fully conversational settings. Conversations are essential for aligning on task details, achieving user-defined goals, and satisfying preferences. While existing agents address ambiguity through clarification questions, they underutilize the broader potential of an LLM's conversational capabilities. In this work, we introduce ReSpAct, an LLM-based agent designed to seamlessly integrate reasoning, decision-making, and dynamic dialogue for task-solving. Expanding on reasoning-first approaches like ReAct, ReSpAct employs active, free-flowing dialogues to interpret instructions, clarify goals, provide status updates, resolve subtask failures, and refine plans based on user inputs without any explicit dialogue schema. By alternating between task-solving actions and interactive conversations, ReSpAct demonstrates improved performance across diverse environments. We evaluate ReSpAct in user-interactive settings, including task-oriented dialogue systems (MultiWOZ) and decision-making tasks (ALFWorld, WebShop). ReSpAct outperforms ReAct with absolute success rate improvements of 6% and 4% in ALFWorld and WebShop, respectively, and achieves a 5.5% gain in Inform and a 3% gain in Success scores in MultiWOZ.

As a means of creating a formal framework for controlling systems of this form, and with a view toward automotive applications, this paper develops a methodology that allows safety conditions—expressed as  control barrier functions—to be unified with performance objectives—expressed as control Lyapunov functions—in the context of real-time optimization-based controllers. Safety conditions are specified in terms of forward invariance of a set, and are verified via two novel generalizations of barrier functions; in each case, the existence of a barrier function satisfying Lyapunov-like conditions implies forward invariance of the set, and the relationship between these two classes of barrier functions is characterized. In addition, each of these formulations yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), providing inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). The mediation of safety and performance through a QP is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, two automotive control problems that present both safety and performance considerations coupled with actuator bounds.",

In this work, we introduce a novel Traversability-based Control Barrier Function (T-CBF), in which we use neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to achieve safety beyond collision avoidance on unstructured vertically challenging terrain by reasoning about new safety aspects in terms of traversability. The neural T-CBF trained on safe and unsafe observations specific to traversability safety is then used to generate safe trajectories. Furthermore, we present experimental results in simulation and on a physical Verti-4 Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that T-CBF can provide traversability safety while reaching the goal position.

Multi-agent collaborative SLAM improves scalability and consistency by distributing mapping tasks and sharing observations, making it suitable for large-scale environments.

This is primarily limited by the lack of capabilities in current 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM methods for addressing global drift, loop closure detection, and scene gap filling in multi-agent collaborative scenarios. This letter proposes MANG-SLAM, a progressive dense SLAM system that integrates multi-agent collaboration with neural submaps. By leveraging Neural Submaps to guide 3DGS rendering, MANG-SLAM achieves efficient optimization from local to global levels and supports parallel mapping by multi-agents. Each agent independently generates submaps, which are fused on the server side for submap integration, loop closure detection, and global optimization. This approach effectively corrects accumulated drift, improves geometric consistency, and enables gap filling.

    "abstract": "The multi-agent task allocation can be solved in a distributed manner using Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA). Under this distributed auction process, each agent greedily maximizes the global score, which is the difference of the reward and the cost, through an iterative bundle construction and conflict resolution procedure. The distributed algorithm has provable convergence and guarantees 50% optimality if the score function satisfies the condition of diminishing marginal gain (DMG). While the previous work focuses on unconstrained optimization of rewards, this paper aims at applying CBBA to task allocation with budget constraints. Several heuristics were proposed to build the bundle and calculate the bidding scores as improvements to the original CBBA algorithm. We then prove that some of the new score functions are DMG, and therefore guarantees the convergence of the distributed process. We also show that these heuristic extended CBBAs are Pareto efficient; using different heuristic extensions under different scenarios is more efficient than consistently using the same one. To decide which heuristic extension should be used for a given task allocation problem, a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model is trained to extract and analyze the features of the constrained optimization problem as a graph, and predict the potential performance (i.e., global reward) of different heuristic extensions. Based on the prediction, the best heuristic extension will be selected. Experimental results show that the predicted reward has more than 0.98 correlation with the actual reward and for 70% of time the prediction guided selection picks the best heuristic extension for the budget constrained task allocation problem.",

    "abstract": "To maximize the utilization of system resources and improve the overall execution effectiveness of task offloading in vehicle networking is the aim of this paper, which enables vehicles to access various intelligent services through the Internet. Due to the limited computing power and energy of vehicles, task offloading can improve the performance and efficiency of complex and time-consuming tasks by leveraging the edge servers. However, task offloading also involves the trade-off and coordination among multiple vehicles and servers, which poses a great challenge for task and resource allocation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method that combines multi-agent reinforcement learning and reverse auction mechanism, which allows vehicles and servers to learn and optimize their own bidding strategies for task offloading, and achieve a fair and efficient outcome. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks is employed to train our multi-agent reinforcement learning model. We conduct extensive experiments in our open-source Python-based simulation environment, VehicleJobScheduling, which can realistically model the vehicle networking scenario and provide various evaluation metrics. The study reveals that the PPO+LTSM strategy utilizes LSTM to capture temporal information, enabling more rational decision-making and achieving the most effective load balance.",

In contrast to purely greedy bidding strategies, it enables agents to dynamically update task priorities based on the accumulated loss from previously unsuccessful bids. This extended work reduces globally inefficient allocations caused by early suboptimal decisions. The proposed approach is evaluated through large-scale simulations in thousands of randomized scenarios and swarm sizes ranging from 5 to 120 robots. Compared to existing CBAA and GCAA algorithms, ACALM yields task assignments with higher global efficiency on average. The results also show that ACALM maintains effectiveness with larger swarms, suggesting strong robustness in large decentralized contexts. However, this improvement comes with an increase in communication overhead due to additional consensus rounds. Potential extensions include methods to reduce communication costs, support for multiple assignments per robot, and verification of functionality under asynchronous communication.",

An attractive–repulsive distance-based potential-field (ARD-PF) controller is used as an expert to generate demonstrations for imitation learning in multi-UAV cooperative systems. By augmenting the training data with communication delay, the learned policy implicitly compensates for outdated neighbor information and improves swarm coordination during autonomous flight. Extensive simulations across different swarm sizes, formation spacings, and delay levels show that delay-robust imitation learning significantly enlarges the probabilistic stability region compared with classical ARD-PF control and non-robust learning baselines. Formation control performance is evaluated using internal geometric error, global offset, and multi-run stability metrics. In addition, a predictive delay–stability model is introduced, linking the maximum admissible communication delay to swarm size and inter-agent spacing, with low fitting error against simulated stability boundaries.

Based on the adaptive backstepping technology, a cooperative tracking controller is designed that can track the moving targets in a limited time. First, this article considers the visual sensor model, and then a backstepping method is used to design a controller for each UAV, and these controllers are used to design an integrated controller for the whole system that overcomes the sensor dead zone and the control signal quantization effect. Second, by applying the approximation property of the neural network, the unknown control gain of the non-strict feedback system can be compensated, and the nonlinear quantization system of UAV actuator dead zone can realize stable dynamic characteristics in a limited time.

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the cooperative formation control problem of six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under constraints of limited communication resources and strict time requirements. The core innovation of the proposed framework lies in the deep integration of a dynamic self-triggered communication mechanism (DSTCM) with a prescribed-time control strategy. Furthermore, a fuzzy control strategy is designed to effectively suppress system disturbances, enhancing the robustness of the formation. The designed DSTCM not only retains the adaptive triggering threshold characteristic of dynamic event-triggered communication, significantly reducing communication frequency, but also completely eliminates the need for continuous state monitoring required by traditional event-triggered mechanisms. As a result, both communication and onboard computational resources are effectively conserved. In parallel, a novel time-varying unilateral constrained performance function is introduced to construct a prescribed-time controller, which guarantees that the formation tracking error converges to a predefined residual set within a user-specified time. The convergence process is independent of initial conditions and strictly adheres to full-state constraints. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis demonstrates that all signals in the closed-loop UAV velocity and attitude system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Furthermore, the proposed DSTCM ensures the existence of a strictly positive lower bound on the inter-event triggering intervals of the UAVs, thereby avoiding the occurrence of Zeno behavior. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.",

This paper presents an integrated navigation framework that combines chart-based global path planning with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach for local trajectory tracking and COLREG-compliant collision avoidance. The method generates feasible reference routes using maritime charts and predefined waypoints, while the MPC controller ensures precise path following and dynamic re-planning in response to nearby vessels and coastal obstacles. Coastal features and shorelines are modeled using Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography data, enabling MPC to treat landmasses as static obstacles. Other vessels are represented as dynamic obstacles with varying speeds and headings, and COLREG rules are embedded within the MPC framework to enable rule-compliant maneuvering during encounters. To address real-time computational constraints, a simplified MPC formulation is introduced, balancing predictive accuracy with computational efficiency, making the approach suitable for embedded implementations. The navigation framework is implemented in a MATLAB-based simulation with real-time visualization supporting multi-vessel scenarios and COLREG-aware vessel interactions. Simulation results demonstrate robust performance across diverse maritime scenarios—including complex multi-ship encounters and constrained coastal navigation—while maintaining the shortest safe routes. By seamlessly integrating chart-aware path planning with COLREG-compliant, MPC-based collision avoidance, the proposed framework offers an effective, scalable, and robust solution for autonomous maritime navigation.",

Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.",

    "abstract": "In response to the fact that autonomous vehicles cannot avoid obstacles by emergency braking alone, this paper proposes an active collision avoidance method for autonomous vehicles based on model predictive control (MPC). The method includes trajectory tracking, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and active obstacle avoidance under high vehicle speed. Firstly, an MPC-based trajectory tracking controller is designed based on the vehicle dynamics model. Then, the MPC was combined with ACC to design the control strategies for vehicle braking to avoid collisions. Additionally, active steering for collision avoidance was developed based on the safety distance model. Finally, considering the distance between the vehicle and the obstacle and the relative speed, an obstacle avoidance function is constructed. A path planning controller based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is designed. In addition, the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) is used to accelerate the solution process and further ensure the safety of the obstacle avoidance process. The proposed algorithm is tested on the Simulink and CarSim co-simulation platform in both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios. Results show that the method effectively achieves collision avoidance through braking. It also demonstrates good stability and robustness in steering to avoid collisions at high speeds. The experiments confirm that the vehicle can return to the desired path after avoiding obstacles, verifying the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In addressing the optimal motion planning issue for multi-arm rock drilling robots, this paper introduces a high-precision motion planning method based on Multi-Strategy Sampling RRT* (MSS-RRT*). A dual Jacobi iterative inverse solution method, coupled with a forward kinematics error compensation model, is introduced to dynamically correct target positions, improving end-effector positioning accuracy. A multi-strategy sampling mechanism is constructed by integrating DRL position sphere sampling, spatial random sampling, and goal-oriented sampling. This mechanism flexibly applies three sampling methods at different stages of path planning, significantly improving the adaptability and search efficiency of the RRT* algorithm. In particular, DRL position sphere sampling is prioritized during the initial phase, effectively reducing the number of invalid sampling points. For training a three-arm DRL model with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3), the Hindsight Experience Replay-Obstacle Arm Transfer (HER-OAT) method is used for data replay. The cylindrical bounding box method effectively prevents collisions between arms. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves motion planning accuracy by 94.15% compared to a single Jacobi iteration. MSS-RRT* can plan a superior path in a shorter duration, with the planning time under optimal path conditions being only 20.71% of that required by Informed-RRT*, and with the path length reduced by 21.58% compared to Quick-RRT* under the same time constraints.",

    "abstract": "Motion planning is challenging for robotic manipulators. Achieving high efficiency and generalization while considering various constraints simultaneously can be difficult. One common solution is to use iterative projection techniques to acquire feasible manipulator configurations and then search for a valid path to reach the goal state based on those configurations. However, such iterative techniques tend to be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The problem becomes more serious if equality constraints are involved, due to their narrower solution space. In this paper, we propose the Learning-Assisted Constrained Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (LAC-RRT) algorithm, which employs self-supervised learning to train a model that can directly convert any sampled configuration to a new and valid configuration using feature values constrained by the imposed equality constraints, avoiding the need for iterative optimizations. Unlike other learning-based motion planning techniques, which typically solve the problem by building the constraint manifold based on a fixed set of constraints, LAC-RRT permits better generalization by allowing the equality constraints to be specified at run time. The experimental results show that the proposed LAC-RRT surpasses other approaches in most cases. Specifically, LAC-RRT can significantly reduce computation time by 80-90% for acquiring valid configurations and performing motion planning.",

In particular, the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and its asymptotically-optimal counterpart called RRT * are popular algorithms used in real-life applications due to its desirable properties. Such algorithms are inherently iterative, but certain modules such as the collision-checking procedure can be parallelized providing significant speedup with respect to sequential implementations. In this paper, the RRT and RRT * algorithms have been adapted to a bioinspired computational framework called Membrane Computing whose models of computation, a.k.a. P systems, run in a non-deterministic and massively parallel way. A large number of robotic applications are currently using a variant of P systems called Enzymatic Numerical P systems (ENPS) for reactive controlling, but there is a lack of solutions for motion planning in the framework. The novel models in this work have been designed using the ENPS framework. In order to test and validate the ENPS models for RRT and RRT * , we present two ad-hoc implementations able to emulate the computation of the models using OpenMP and CUDA. Finally, we show the speedup of our solutions with respect to sequential baseline implementations. The results show a speedup up to 6x using OpenMP with 8 cores against the sequential implementation and up to 24x using CUDA against the best multi-threading configuration.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. The work analyzes features of one of the most promising approaches to solve the problems for motion planning of autonomous robotic manipulators of various types and purposes using the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) method. The development of modern robotics is shown to be inextricably linked with the improvement of the designs of the created samples, for which the placement of a manipulator on platform becomes a typical layout option. Prospects for using the RRT method as a constructive basis for creating a universal motion planner are evaluated for mobile and robotic manipulators, including autonomous robotic systems with a manipulator on a moving platform.Methods. The object of the research is the RRT method and its well-known modifications RRT* and RRT-Connect. The effectiveness of applying such methods for solving problems associated with planning the motions of robotic manipulators of various types was evaluated using computer and natural simulation methods.Results. Based on a review of the literature and the results of the research, the wide possibilities of the RRT method can be used for solving motion planning problems not only for mobile and robotic manipulators, but also for robotic systems on whose transport platform an onboard manipulator has been installed (including those having a redundant or reconfigurable structure). The effectiveness of the applied application of the RRT method is confirmed by examples of modeling a mobile platform with an onboard manipulator and the results of full-scale experiments with a prototype of the ARAKS reconfigurable mechatronic-modular robotic manipulators (RTU MIREA, Russia). It can be experimentally demonstrated and theoretically substantiated that the final dimension of the exploring tree, and hence the time of its construction up to reaching a given target state, is largely determined by the value of the growth factor.Conclusions. The generalization of the results obtained opens up real prospects for using the RRT method as a constructive basis not only for creating universal means for motion planning mobile robotic systems with an onboard manipulator, but also for solving the problems of automating the docking of autonomous mobile platforms.",

The ability of autonomous agents in such systems to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles while navigating through an obstacle-cluttered environment is critical for success in any mission. In addition to that, further challenges are posed by environments with uncertainties in obstacles’ motion, sensing, and occluded regions. To this end, a higher-order velocity obstacle–based novel motion planner is presented in this paper in a probabilistic setup for smooth, collision-free navigation of the agent with acceleration constraints in uncertain, unstructured environments with an element of anticipation for the future environment. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm for safe, collision-free, and smooth navigation of the agent is investigated in simulation studies in two different kinds of environments, one with known trajectories of obstacles and the other with unknown maneuvering trajectories of obstacles. Extensive simulation studies are performed in the presence of dynamic obstacles to elucidate the performance of the proposed algorithm on four crucial parameters—mission time, computational time, minimum obstacle distance, and an overall control effort under varied obstacle densities. With satisfactory performance in all these aspects, the developed algorithm possesses strong potential for real-time implementation.",

However, these models are prone to generating inaccurate or invented responses, known as hallucinations, that can produce an erratic robotic operation. This can be addressed by employing agentic workflows, structured processes that guide and refine the model’s output to improve response quality. This work formally defines and qualitatively analyzes the impact of three agentic workflows (LLM Ensemble, Self-Reflection, and Multi-Agent Reflection) on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of an LLM guiding a robotic system to perform object-centered planning. In this context, the LLM is provided with a pre-built semantic map of the environment and a query, to which it must respond by determining the most relevant objects for the query. This response can be used in a multitude of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments were carried out employing state-of-the-art LLMs and semantic maps generated from the widely-used datasets ScanNet and SceneNN. The results show that agentic workflows significantly enhance object retrieval performance, especially in scenarios requiring complex reasoning, with improvements averaging up to 10% over the baseline.",

In this work, we propose LLM-A*, an new LLM based route planning method that synergistically combines the precise pathfinding capabilities of A* with the global reasoning capability of LLMs. This hybrid approach aims to enhance pathfinding efficiency in terms of time and space complexity while maintaining the integrity of path validity, especially in large-scale scenarios.

    "abstract": "In recent years, automation has significantly advanced the automobile manufacturing industry. However, many tasks still involve human intervention, so there is a demand for the development of robots to support workers. Additionally, as the human-centric approach, such as Industry 5.0, is gaining attention, it is expected that support robots like these will become necessary in the future. This study aims to develop a system that can support workers by utilizing robots that anyone can easily use and flexibly respond to various tasks. This system adopts a large language model (LLM) for work planning and generates tasks that robots can execute by making bidirectional and interactive suggestions and modifications through natural language dialogue in response to human demands, aiming to improve further productivity and the working environment in automobile manufacturing factories. The proposed system was tested in a simulated factory environment and then the performance was confirmed in an actual factory setting. And it was confirmed that various tasks can be executed by robot through work planning and dialogue with the LLM.",

Most studies focused on task planning for clear natural language commands that specify target objects and their locations. However, for more user-friendly task execution, it is crucial for robots to autonomously plan and carry out tasks based on abstract natural language commands that may not explicitly mention target objects or locations, such as ‘Put the food ingredients in the same place.’ In this study, we propose an LLM-based autonomous task planning framework that generates task plans for abstract natural language commands. This framework consists of two phases: an environment recognition phase and a task planning phase. In the environment recognition phase, a large vision-language model generates a hierarchical scene graph that captures the relationships between objects and spaces in the environment surrounding a robot agent. During the task planning phase, an LLM uses the scene graph and the abstract user command to formulate a plan for the given task. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the AI2THOR simulation environment, demonstrating its superior performance in task execution when handling abstract commands.",

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms.

    "abstract": "The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework shows great potential in terms of improving the reasoning and knowledge utilization capabilities of language models. However, most existing RAG systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs) and suffer severe performance degradation when using small language models (SLMs), which limits their efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Adaptive-Planning RAG (RAP-RAG), a lightweight and high-efficiency RAG framework with adaptive retrieval task planning that is compatible with both SLMs and LLMs simultaneously. RAP-RAG is built on three key components: (1) a heterogeneous weighted graph index that integrates semantic similarity and structural connectivity; (2) a set of retrieval methods that balance efficiency and reasoning power; and (3) an adaptive planner that dynamically selects appropriate strategies based on query features. Experiments on the LiHua-World, MultiHop-RAG, and Hybrid-SQuAD datasets show that RAP-RAG consistently outperforms representative baseline models such as GraphRAG, LightRAG, and MiniRAG. Compared to lightweight baselines, RAP-RAG achieves 3–5% accuracy improvement while maintaining high efficiency and maintains comparable efficiency in both small and large model settings. In addition, our proposed framework reduces storage size by 15% compared to mainstream frameworks. Component analysis further confirms the necessity of weighted graphs and adaptive programming for robust retrieval under multi-hop reasoning and heterogeneous query conditions. These results demonstrate that RAP-RAG is a practical and efficient framework for retrieval-enhanced generation, suitable for large-scale and resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Embodied Everyday Task is a popular task in the embodied AI community, requiring agents to make a sequence of actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.",

We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.",

    "abstract": "Treating each intersection as basic agent, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have emerged as the predominant approach for distributed adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in multi-intersection scenarios, such as arterial coordination. MARL-based ATSC currently faces two challenges: disturbances from the control policies of other intersections may impair the learning and control stability of the agents; and the heterogeneous features across intersections may complicate coordination efforts. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel MARL method for distributed ATSC in arterials, termed the Distributed Controller for Heterogeneous Intersections (DCHI). The DCHI method introduces a Neighborhood Experience Sharing (NES) framework, wherein each agent utilizes both local data and shared experiences from adjacent intersections to improve its control policy. Within this framework, the neural networks of each agent are partitioned into two parts following the Knowledge Homogenizing Encapsulation (KHE) mechanism. The first part manages heterogeneous intersection features and transforms the control experiences, while the second part optimizes homogeneous control logic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCHI achieves efficiency improvements in average travel time of over 30% compared to traditional methods and yields similar performance to the centralized sharing method. Furthermore, vehicle trajectories reveal that DCHI can adaptively establish green wave bands in a distributed manner. Given its superior control performance, accommodation of heterogeneous intersections, and low reliance on information networks, DCHI could significantly advance the application of MARL-based ATSC methods in practice.",

    "abstract": "In target-oriented multi-agent tasks, agents collaboratively achieve goals defined by specific objects, or targets, in their environment. The key to success is the effective coordination between agents and these targets, especially in dynamic environments where targets may shift. Agents must adeptly adjust to these changes and re-evaluate their target interactions. Inefficient coordination can lead to resource waste, extended task times, and lower overall performance. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the regulatory hierarchical multi-agent coordination (RHMC), a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. RHMC divides the coordination task into two levels: a high-level policy, assigning targets based on environmental state, and a low-level policy, executing basic actions guided by individual target assignments and observations. Stabilizing RHMC’s high-level policy is crucial for effective learning. This stability is achieved by reward regularization, reducing reliance on the dynamic low-level policy. Such regularization ensures the high-level policy remains focused on broad coordination, not overly dependent on specific agent actions. By minimizing low-level policy dependence, RHMC adapts more seamlessly to environmental changes, boosting learning efficiency. Testing demonstrates RHMC’s superiority over existing methods in global reward and learning efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in multi-agent coordination.",

The flexibility and accuracy of path planning are improved through dual-end search strategy and slope factor optimisation cost function, combined with dynamic heuristic function, and the intelligent scheduling and emergency management system of the mining area is constructed by combining digital twin technology. The experimental results show that the improved bidirectional A* algorithm is superior to the traditional method in terms of path planning efficiency, accuracy and adaptability, with 23 iterations, 23.67 m path length and 820 node extensions. The success rate in high-density obstacle areas is 97.67%, and the average in steep slope areas is 93.04%. Combined with the digital twin technology, the path adjustment time is reduced to 618.47 ms, the success rate is increased to 95.12%, the response time is reduced to 45.76 s, and the transportation time is optimised to 19.32 min in the level 6 blocking scenario, showing superior dynamic adaptability.

This letter introduces a novel method for controlling milling behavior in real-world robots, where both the direction and radius of the milling pattern can be continuously adjusted by tuning a single parameter. Inspired by visual attention mechanisms, the proposed model introduces the concept of gazing preference. That is, the robot will prefer to choose a neighbor in a particular direction for interaction, which in turn creates a force that deviates from the direction of velocity and leads to the milling behavior. Additionally, a potential function ensures swarm cohesion and prevents collisions through simulated repulsive and attractive forces. Simulations and experiments involving up to 50 robots demonstrate that adjusting the gazing preference parameter enables seamless control of the rotation direction and fine-tuning of the milling pattern's angular velocity and radius. Overall, this letter provides a straightforward and effective approach for designing controlled milling behavior in swarm robotics.",

    "abstract": "Powered exoskeletons for people with complete paraplegia have been controlled based on predefined joint-reference trajectories. As the target users of such robots may not realize any voluntary movement, the human body is fully constrained and follows the movement of the powered exoskeleton joints. The predefined gait pattern, however, may or may not be adequate for every user because the gait pattern is resulting from complex interactions between the body segments and environment, as well as dynamic characteristics of the body segments. As all the persons and their body segments have different dynamic characteristics, therefore, a bespoke tuning of gait parameters is necessary in order to realize the natural gait motion, which is optimal for each user. In this article, an adaptive gait pattern adjustment method is proposed. The proposed method observes the ground contact timing, which is directly related to the adequacy of the gait pattern for the user wearing a robot. Based on the ground contact timing, the joint-reference trajectories are adjusted, which are parameterized by the trunk inclination angle. The proposed method iteratively calculates an appropriate trunk inclination angle from the information of ground contact timing. In this article, the derivation of the proposed method and its experimental verification with WalkON Suit, a powered exoskeleton, are introduced. The proposed algorithm successfully worked for two practical users with complete paraplegia, and the adapted gait patterns showed excessive performance in walking speed, oxygen consumption, palm force on crutches, etc. The results were also verified by winning both gold and bronze medals in the global competition, Cybathlon 2020, while accomplishing the best records among all the teams.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robots combine skills to form increasingly complex behaviors, called missions. While skills are often programmed at a relatively low abstraction level, their coordination is architecturally separated and often expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks. State machines have been the go-to language to model behavior for decades, but recently, behavior trees have gained attention among roboticists. Originally designed to model autonomous actors in computer games, behavior trees offer an extensible tree-based representation of missions and are claimed to support modular design and code reuse. Although several implementations of behavior trees are in use, little is known about their usage and scope in the real world. How do concepts offered by behavior trees relate to traditional languages, such as state machines? How are concepts in behavior trees and state machines used in actual applications? This paper is a study of the key language concepts in behavior trees as realized in domain-specific languages (DSLs), internal and external DSLs offered as libraries, and their use in open-source robotic applications supported by the Robot Operating System (ROS). We analyze behavior-tree DSLs and compare them to the standard language for behavior models in robotics: state machines. We identify DSLs for both behavior-modeling languages, and we analyze five in-depth. We mine open-source repositories for robotic applications that use the analyzed DSLs and analyze their usage. We identify similarities between behavior trees and state machines in terms of language design and the concepts offered to accommodate the needs of the robotics domain. We observed that the usage of behavior-tree DSLs in open-source projects is increasing rapidly. We observed similar usage patterns at model structure and at code reuse in the behavior-tree and state-machine models within the mined open-source projects. We contribute all extracted models as a dataset, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop behavior trees, associated tools, and analysis techniques.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains including psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments. Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the time-line by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents’ type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments.

    "abstract": "Mobile robots play a pivotal role in advancing smart manufacturing technologies. However, existing Obstacle avoidance path Planning (OP) algorithms for mobile robots suffer from low stability and applicability. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced Secret Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA)-based OP algorithm for mobile robots to address these challenges, termed AGMSBOA. Firstly, an adaptive learning strategy is introduced, where individuals enhance the diversity of the algorithm’s population by summarizing relationships among candidates of varying quality, thereby strengthening the algorithm’s ability to locate globally optimal obstacle avoidance path regions. Secondly, a group learning strategy is incorporated by dividing the population into learning and teaching groups, enhancing the algorithm’s exploitation capabilities, improving the accuracy of obstacle avoidance path planning, and reducing actual runtime. Lastly, a multiple population evolution strategy is proposed, which balances the exploration/exploitation phases of the algorithm by analyzing the nature of different individuals, improving the algorithm’s ability to escape suboptimal obstacle avoidance path traps. Subsequently, AGMSBOA was used to solve the OP problem on five maps and two OP problems in real-world environments. The experiments illustrate that AGMSBOA achieves more than 5% performance improvement in path length and a 100–win rate in runtime metrics, as well as faster convergence and stability of the solution. Therefore, AGMSBOA proposed in this paper is an efficient, robust, and robust OP method for mobile robots.",

A pinhole camera that is equipped with the following robot to monitor the target’ motion is limited field of view (FOV), which relates to the issue of visibility maintenance. Safety navigation is another concern, which requires that the following robot can avoid collisions with the target and static obstacles. Under the IBVS framework, we design novel constrained boundary functions based on pixel coordinate, which can be deviated away from zero to ensure that the following robot drives away from obstacles because obstacle avoidance is a higher priority rather than the tracking task. When there is no obstacle detected, the constrained boundary functions are taken as exponentially decaying functions of time. Using fixed-time stability and control Lyapunov synthesis, the tracking errors are shown to converge in fixed time to a small neighborhood of the desired obstacle-avoidance trajectory generated from the centerline of constrained boundaries while guaranteeing visibility maintenance and obstacle/collision avoidance. The proposed fixed-time IBVS controller (FTIBVSC) only depends on locally relative information acquired by onboard sensors without the need of knowing the feature height and target’s velocity.

Traditional PRM-based methods often struggle with optimizing path length and minimizing turns, particularly in complex, multi-agent scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid PRM-GA approach that incorporates genetic operators to evolve optimal paths for multiple robots in real-time.The research contribution is an enhanced PRM-GA framework that improves efficiency in multi-robot navigation by integrating evolutionary techniques for dynamic obstacle handling and optimized path generation.The research methodology involves testing the algorithm in various environments, including varying robot numbers and environmental complexities, to evaluate its scalability and effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the PRM-GA algorithm successfully reduces both path lengths and turn counts compared to standard PRM-based methods, ensuring collision-free and smooth paths. The algorithm showed robust performance across different scenarios, effectively handling dynamic obstacles and multi-agent coordination. However, in highly dynamic environments with rapidly changing obstacles and constraints, the algorithm may occasionally produce paths with turn counts and distances similar to or slightly higher than those of simpler approaches due to the need for frequent re-optimization. Future research can explore incorporating additional factors such as energy consumption and time optimization, alongside distance and turns, to further enhance the algorithm's efficiency in real-world applications. Overall, the PRM-GA approach advances the state of the art by offering a more adaptable and scalable solution for multi-robot path planning, with applications in logistics, industrial automation, and autonomous robotics.",

First, in the node sampling phase, a normal-distribution-based sampling strategy combined with an adaptive perturbation mechanism is introduced to balance goal-directedness and global randomness, thereby enhancing sampling effectiveness and roadmap efficiency. Second, in the path optimization phase, a redundancy compression method based on angular variation trends and line-of-sight verification is designed: by evaluating angular consistency across consecutive path segments and checking visibility between nodes, redundant points are effectively removed, yielding a more concise and coherent feasible path.

In addition to actively densifying hyper primitives based on geometric features, we further introduce a Gaussian-Pyramid-based training method to progressively learn multi-level features, enhancing photorealistic mapping performance. The extensive experiments with monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets prove that our proposed system Photo-SLAM sig-nificantly outperforms current state-of-the-art SLAM systems for online photorealistic mapping, e.g., PSNR is 30% higher and rendering speed is hundreds of times faster in the Replica dataset. Moreover, the Photo-SLAM can run at real-time speed using an embedded platform such as Jet-son AGX Orin, showing the potential of robotics applications.

In this paper, a mathematical framework is established to integrate SLAM and moving object tracking. Two solutions are described: SLAM with generalized objects, and SLAM with detection and tracking of moving objects (DATMO). SLAM with generalized objects calculates a joint posterior over all generalized objects and the robot. Such an approach is similar to existing SLAM algorithms, but with additional structure to allow for motion modeling of generalized objects. Unfortunately, it is computationally demanding and generally infeasible. SLAM with DATMO decomposes the estimation problem into two separate estimators. By maintaining separate posteriors for stationary objects and moving objects, the resulting estimation problems are much lower dimensional than SLAM with generalized objects. Both SLAM and moving object tracking from a moving vehicle in crowded urban areas are daunting tasks. Based on the SLAM with DATMO framework, practical algorithms are proposed which deal with issues of perception modeling, data association, and moving object detection. The implementation of SLAM with DATMO was demonstrated using data collected from the CMU Navlab11 vehicle at high speeds in crowded urban environments. Ample experimental results shows the feasibility of the proposed theory and algorithms.",

However, resource allocation in the cloud and fog, along with real-time application requirements, pose a number of challenges. In this paper, we examine the problem of auction-based resource allocation for delay-sensitive online IoT applications in the cloud-fog-edge architecture. We propose a multi-attribute double auction-based task allocation algorithm with delay-based pricing and bidding strategy. A novel virtual-bidding mechanism is designed to allocate resources to tasks that arrive in-between the bidding rounds. The price and winners are determined using McAfee and reserved price-based allocation, which also considers the perishable nature of fog/cloud resources. The proposed algorithm is implemented in NetSim and Python. We find a substantive performance boost in resource utilization when virtual bidding is used for online jobs instead of only using periodic auctions. Simulation results show an increase of 61% in resource utilization, 37% in user utility, and 79% in profit for fog service providers.",

    "abstract": "As a complementary solution for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can temporarily provide reliable and flexible offloading services when edge servers are damaged or unavailable. However, existing UAV-assisted MEC systems suffer from issues such as uneven resource allocation, low utilization efficiency, load imbalance, and poor dynamic adaptability, affecting service quality. Moreover, sensitive user equipment (UE) information faces leakage during the computational process of UAVs. How to jointly optimize the scheduling of servers and UAVs for task offloading and resource allocation without compromising UEs’ privacy remains a significant challenge. Thus, this paper proposed a privacy-preserving auction framework (namely Prizty) by considering the trajectory of UAVs, their constrained energy and computational capabilities, and the variability in UE distribution. Prizty employs a combinatorial obfuscation method to protect UEs’ privacy and links bidding prices to computational resources and energy characteristics. It calls the sub-algorithm WPA to determine the winners by balancing social costs and utility. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Prizty satisfies truthfulness and individual rationality while maintaining scalability for large-scale resource allocation problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate Prizty’s effectiveness in critical metrics, including offload rate, average service latency, energy consumption, and social cost.",

In particular, a CoMP set consisting of multiple UAVs is developed based on the theory of Poisson-Delaunay tetrahedralization. Effective UAV formation control and UAV swarm tracking schemes for two typical scenarios, including static and mobile UEs, are also developed using the multi-agent system theory to ensure that collaborative UAVs can efficiently reach target spatial positions for mission execution. Thanks to the ease of mathematical tractability, this model provides explicit performance expressions for a typical UE’s coverage probability and achievable ergodic rate.

The framework adopts a collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration, a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework’s effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.",

Assuming no constraints, vehicles then use analytical optimal control methods to determine a nominal acceleration profile intended to place them at the intersection at the desired arrival time. Finally, using control barrier functions, the agents' accelerations and arrival times are modified to ensure safety and feasibility. The work in this paper builds on existing research on safe-set nonlinear control methods, multi-agent gradient based methods, and optimal control methods used to tackle the intelligent intersection management problem. Here, we integrate the use of these different approaches to present a comprehensive control architecture that can flexibly coordinate the timing of both vehicles and traffic lights, while maintaining safety and feasibility.

First, a self-learning optimal formation policy enables agents to achieve optimal formation configuration, wherein optimal performance is guaranteed via a computationally-efficient adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework. Furthermore, by revisiting real-time and historical information, a novel weight updating rule with fixed-time convergence is elaborated, such that rapid weight regulation is realized without depending on the initial choices. Second, a minimally-invasive safe control policy with high-order control barrier function constraints is constructed in obstacles-clustered environments, wherein collision risk is excluded by ensuring the forward invariance of the safety set. It is strictly proved that closed-loop errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, extensive simulations are verified the values and superiorities of proposed method.",

Furthermore, it remains a challenge when there are additional constraints on control torques of robotic systems. In this article, we propose a novel high-order control barrier function (HoCBF)-based safety control method for robotic systems subject to input-output constraints, which can maintain the desired smoothness of system states and reduce undesired chattering vibration in the control torque. In our design, augmented dynamics are introduced into the HoCBF by constructing its output as the control input of the robotic system, so that the constraint satisfaction is facilitated by HoCBFs and the smoothness of system states is maintained by the augmented dynamics. This proposed scheme leads to the quadratic program (QP), which is more user-friendly in implementation since the constraint satisfaction control design is implemented as an add-on to an existing tracking control law. The proposed closed-loop control system not only achieves the requirements of real-time capability, stability, safety and compliance, but also reduces undesired chattering of control inputs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by simulations and experiments on robotic manipulators.",

And agents must sequentially determine their actions independently without full knowledge of the state of the environment. We will look for long-term strategies, which involve constantly assigning new goals to the agent as it reaches previous goals. To address this complex challenge, we propose an approach that combines two complementary approaches: heuristic search planning and reinforcement learning through strategy optimization. Planning is used to build and re-plan individual paths, and we have enhanced our planning algorithms with specialized techniques designed to prevent congestion and improve the throughput of the system. We also use reinforcement learning to develop collision avoidance strategies that effectively guide agents along their paths. These strategies are implemented in the form of neural networks that can be effectively trained without additional reward shaping or additional external planning. We evaluate our approach in a wide range of scenarios, comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions.

While distributed self-organization methods based on shape discrete layers offer high scalability and adaptability, these approaches are prone to local minima, which can prevent task completion in complex settings. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a hierarchical control framework that integrates the A* global pathfinding algorithm with a distributed shape discrete layer controller. The A* algorithm first generates a safe, globally optimal reference path that accounts for static obstacles. Subsequently, the distributed controller guides a swarm of agents to track this path, while concurrently handling local collision avoidance and self-organizing into a desired formation. Simulation experiments demonstrate that a swarm of 37 agents can successfully follow the global path, navigate a complex obstacle field, and converge into a predefined \"snowflake\" formation at the target location.

    "abstract": "The collaborative path planning and scheduling can overcome the limitations of single vehicle intelligence to obtain a globally optimal decision strategy in cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoVs). The collaboration of vehicles necessitates the exchange of environmental and decision information, generating massive collaborative computing tasks with strict latency requirements. Leveraging mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, computing tasks can be processed near the vehicles to reduce latency. However, traffic congestion and computational load imbalance seriously affect traffic efficiency and computational latency. In hybrid driving scenarios, it is challenging to fulfill the diverse service requirements of vehicles with different intelligence levels. Moreover, non-collaborative tend to result in traffic congestion due to vehicle aggregation effects, while centralized solutions lack flexibility and have high computational complexity. To address these concerns, a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) algorithm is proposed for collaborative path planning and scheduling in a blockchain-based collaboration framework. In this framework, we model the communication, traffic situation and task processing of the system and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize both travel time and computation latency. Last, we convert the scheduling problem for different types of vehicles into Markov decision processes (MDPs) and propose Q-learning-based DMARL algorithm to achieve proactive load balancing of both road infrastructures and MEC nodes (MECNs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of load balance indexes of roads and MECNs, travel time, and computation latency.",

To relax the problem, this paper provides a distributed design scheme and an online synthesis method for SMs. The base of the framework is a task-priority-based control method for redundant robots. We expand it by introducing an abstract data structure specialized in robotic behaviors.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of demands in marine resource exploitation, environmental monitoring, and maritime safety, cooperative operations based on Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for intelligent ocean missions. UAVs offer flexibility and high coverage efficiency but suffer from limited endurance due to restricted battery capacity, making them unsuitable for large-scale tasks alone. In contrast, USVs provide long endurance and can serve as mobile motherships and energy-supply platforms, enabling UAVs to take off, land, recharge, or replace batteries. Therefore, how to achieve cooperative path planning and energy replenishment scheduling for USV–UAV systems in complex marine environments remains a crucial challenge. This study proposes a USV–UAV cooperative path planning and energy replenishment optimization method based on BeiDou high-precision positioning. First, a unified system model is established, incorporating task coverage, energy constraints, and replenishment scheduling, and formulating the problem as a multi-objective optimization model with the goals of minimizing total mission time, energy consumption, and waiting time, while maximizing task completion rate. Second, a bi-level optimization framework is designed: the upper layer optimizes the USV’s dynamic trajectory and docking positions, while the lower layer optimizes UAV path planning and battery replacement scheduling. A closed-loop interaction mechanism is introduced, enabling the system to adaptively adjust according to task execution status and UAV energy consumption, thus preventing task failures caused by battery depletion. Furthermore, an improved hybrid algorithm combining genetic optimization and multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed, featuring adaptive task allocation and dynamic priority-based replenishment scheduling. A comprehensive reward function integrating task coverage, energy consumption, waiting time, and collision penalties is designed to enhance global optimization and intelligent coordination. Extensive simulations in representative marine scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline strategies. Specifically, it achieves around higher task completion rate, shorter mission time, lower total energy consumption, and shorter waiting time. Moreover, the variance of energy consumption across UAVs is notably reduced, indicating a more balanced workload distribution. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in large-scale, long-duration maritime missions, providing valuable insights for future intelligent ocean operations and cooperative unmanned systems.",

    "abstract": "The trajectory planning for Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the dynamic environments is a challenging task. Many restrictions should be taken into consideration, including dynamic terrain collision, no-fly zone criteria, power and fuel criteria and so on. However, some methods treat dynamic restrictions as static in order to reduce cost and obtain efficient and acceptable paths. To achieve optimal, efficient and acceptable paths, we first use a high-dimension matrix, extended hierarchical graph, to model the unexplored dynamic grid environment and to convert weather conditions to passable coefficient. The original shortest path planning task is then translated to plan the safest path. Therefore, we propose a new forward exploration and backward navigation algorithm, matrix alignment Dijkstra (MAD), to pilot UAVs. We use matrix alignment operation to simulate the parallel exploration process of all cells from time t to t+1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$t+1$$\\end{document}. This exploration process can be accelerated on a GPU. Finally, we recall the optimal path according to the navigator matrix. In addition, we can achieve UAV path planning from one source cell to multiple target cells within one single run. We validate our method on a real dynamic weather dataset and get competitive results in both efficiency and accuracy. We analyse the performance of MAD on a grid-based benchmark dataset and artificial maze data. Simulated results show MAD is especially helpful when the grid-based environment is large-scale and dynamic.",

    "abstract": "We propose the Cooperative Aerial Robot Inspection Challenge (CARIC), a simulation-based benchmark for motion planning algorithms in heterogeneous multi-UAV systems. CARIC features UAV teams with complementary sensors, realistic constraints, and evaluation metrics prioritizing inspection quality and efficiency. It offers a ready-to-use perception-control software stack and diverse scenarios to support the development and evaluation of task allocation and motion planning algorithms. Competitions using CARIC were held at IEEE CDC 2023 and the IROS 2024 Workshop on Multi-Robot Perception and Navigation, attracting innovative solutions from research teams worldwide. This paper examines the top three teams from CDC 2023, analyzing their exploration, inspection, and task allocation strategies while drawing insights into their performance across scenarios. The results highlight the task's complexity and suggest promising directions for future research in cooperative multi-UAV systems.",
